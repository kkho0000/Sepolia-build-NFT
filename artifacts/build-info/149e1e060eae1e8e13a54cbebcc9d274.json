is the concatenation   of `_baseURI` and `_tokenURIs[tokenId]` (keep in mind that `_baseURI`   is empty per default); - if `_tokenURIs[tokenId]` is NOT set then we fallback to `super.uri()`   which in most cases will contain `ERC1155._uri`; - if `_tokenURIs[tokenId]` is NOT set, and if the parents do not have a   uri value set, then the result is empty.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MyNFT.sol\":\"MyNFT\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xba43b97fba0d32eb4254f6a5a297b39a19a247082a02d6e69349e071e2946218\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fc980984badf3984b6303b377711220e067722bbd6a135b24669ff5069ef9f32\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPHXMSXj99XjSVM21YsY6aNtLLjLVXDbyN76J5HQYvvrz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x81149353c99ccf8ff18af7701bc3f38665c7a97e344cdc0d27f927f03d22af0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b488da93995672b613897afa8ed85bb10442351ed54124001832bf2944108601\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP2fX6BzbgZyskxXqckeMzC1C3g7wKEbdtZfMegHoGW3j\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcab667ddad478ff0d39c2053ca77fac778af8483c18ab07d810277b4216fd582\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://919c7ea27c77275c3c341da0c4a26a66a20ed27605fbe8becf11f58ec3bc65bf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRLKyVE2n7e2Jo4bLNn8eLgqqhNGYnVQyjJPWdr8poskf\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155Receiver.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xeb373f1fdc7b755c6a750123a9b9e3a8a02c1470042fd6505d875000a80bde0b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0e28648f994abf1d6bc345644a361cc0b7efa544f8bc0c8ec26011fed85a91ec\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVVE7AiRjKaQYYji7TkjmTeVzGpNmms5eoxqTCfvvpj6D\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/extensions/ERC1155URIStorage.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4e7bcc6aa9b150e125df8afbfbca5dfb7c92fa4fb01985f2f595ce0c96153cff\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://75aa1a94e176c23d37e117daf8386cd6301119b1ca5cf521fe22de9ccc13dade\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfTfUFGRZ3iNavQgLmj2zNR7Pz2djKV5UPRTmDWnapbGg\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/extensions/IERC1155MetadataURI.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa66d18b9a85458d28fc3304717964502ae36f7f8a2ff35bc83f6f85d74b03574\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e46c80ea068989111d6103e5521223f9ef337e93de76deed8b03f75c6f7b2797\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNoSE6knNfFncdDDLTb3fGR6oSQty1srG96Vsx3E9wQdw\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x006dd67219697fe68d7fbfdea512e7c4cb64a43565ed86171d67e844982da6fa\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://2455248c8ddd9cc6a7af76a13973cddf222072427e7b0e2a7d1aff345145e931\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfYjnjRbWqYpuxurqveE6HtzsY1Xx323J428AKQgtBJZm\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf0018c2440fbe238dd3a8732fa8e17a0f9dce84d31451dc8a32f6d62b349c9f1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://59e1c62884d55b70f3ae5432b44bb3166ad71ae3acd19c57ab6ddc3c87c325ee\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmezuXg5GK5oeA4F91EZhozBFekhq5TD966bHPH18cCqhu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x3088eb2868e8d13d89d16670b5f8612c4ab9ff8956272837d8e90106c59c14a0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b81d9ff6559ea5c47fc573e17ece6d9ba5d6839e213e6ebc3b4c5c8fe4199d7f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPCW1bFisUzJkyjroY3yipwfism9RRCigCcK1hbXtVM8n\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd10975de010d89fd1c78dc5e8a9a7e7f496198085c151648f20cba166b32582b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fb0048dee081f6fffa5f74afc3fb328483c2a30504e94a0ddd2a5114d731ec4d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZptt1nmYoA5SgjwnSgWqgUSDgm4q52Yos3xhnMv3MV43\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe4455ac1eb7fc497bb7402579e7b4d64d928b846fce7d2b6fde06d366f21c2b3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://cc8841b3cd48ad125e2f46323c8bad3aa0e88e399ec62acb9e57efa7e7c8058c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSqE4mXHA2BXW58deDbXE8MTcsL5JSKNDbm23sVQxRLPS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SignedMath.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf92515413956f529d95977adc9b0567d583c6203fc31ab1c23824c35187e3ddc\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c50fcc459e49a9858b6d8ad5f911295cb7c9ab57567845a250bf0153f84a95c7\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmcEW85JRzvDkQggxiBBLVAasXWdkhEysqypj9EaB6H2g6\"]},\"contracts/MyNFT.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x403c25b226f057ae1dbfa5826043a5b7d80a338f647be15b0c85afa746676a93\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://052309d5b303f9fb373999434ae84dd71e33c0529720d38cf65704cd8290d360\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVd1dQ6qsWhV55VQrGR89iWqF1M7t6q9XYSq6ho
